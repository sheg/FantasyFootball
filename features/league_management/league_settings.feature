Feature: Update League Settings
  As a league manager
  Before a league starts, I would like the ability to update league info
  So that I can flexibly customize my league

  Scenario: update league entry fee
  Scenario: update league size
  Scenario: allow teams to choose their own draft order
  Scenario: set up table to have canned league settings (i.e. number of week with playoffs, without playoffs, etc)
